# Design patterns
## Springboot
### Dependency injection
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows the Spring framework to inject dependencies into objects at runtime, rather than having objects create their dependencies manually.

Used in: For development I use an H2 memory database while for production postgreSQL will be used. This is done using dependency injection at run time.
